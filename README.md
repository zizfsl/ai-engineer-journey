I am starting a structured 18-month journey to become an Applied AI Engineer while working full-time (40 hours per week).

## Commitment
- Weekly commitment: 15–17 hours

- Approach: Build publicly and document everything

## Goal
To transition into AI Engineering through consistent execution, real-world projects, and public accountability.

## Structure
Each month will include:
- Technical learning
- Project building
- Public documentation
- GitHub tracking
